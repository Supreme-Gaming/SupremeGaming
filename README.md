# SupremeGaming

Work-in-progress monorepo for all of Supreme Gaming's data services. All of the projects and applications are written using TypeScript in a flavor of frameworks (NestJS for backend, Angular for front-end).

All of our existing services are held in private repositories in embarrassing states so not all are available here yet but will slowly be.

## Working services/applications

- `supreme-discord-community-bot-node`
  - Template-based responses for community general help, reference, faq information. This bot likely won't be huge help outside of the Supreme Gaming community.
- `supreme-discord-ticket-bot-node`
  - Simple ticketing system that permits discord server owners to run their own private instance of a ticket bot and maintain control of all of their data.

## Non-working/WIP services/applications

- Supreme Gaming website
- Supreme Gaming data api
- Ark data caching service (re-written in TS and built on top of [knightzac19's](https://github.com/knightzac19/NodeJS-ArkData).
- Donation processing services (patreon and paypal)
