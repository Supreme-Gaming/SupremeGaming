  <h1>Why Donate?</h1>

  <p>
    Supreme Gaming operates 100% through community contributions; from data center space fees to licenses to the various
    software pieces we employ to that make our game servers what they are. Contributions are also 100% voluntary so only
    donate if you are able and would like to help keep the lights on. So long as we have the support of the community,
    Supreme Gaming will continue to operate. In exchange for your contribution, we have devised a series of perks and rewards
    to make it worth your while.
