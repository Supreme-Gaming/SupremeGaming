<h1>Custom Supply Drop Table</h1>

<p class="trailer-2">
  On your mark. Get set. Go! This table is not plug-n-play mod that all other servers use, but instead a table defined from
  the ground up that is unique to SupremeArk and SupremeArk alone. The purpose of it is to redefine drop hunting by making
  them worth hunting. This applies to all drops: surface, cave, and deep sea. In these you will find armors and weapons of
  differing qualities as well as resources, and rare holiday skins. As this is a custom drop table, there is no steam mod
  dependency and as a result one less mod to worry about.
